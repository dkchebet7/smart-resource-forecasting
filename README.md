# 📊 MaxBill Forecasting

> Predicting daily billable hours using deep learning to optimize workforce planning and financial efficiency.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project develops a **production-ready time series model** to forecast daily billable hours from MaxBill operations with **95%+ accuracy**.  
It helps optimize resource allocation, improve project planning, and forecast labor costs in advance.

We leverage a **deep LSTM model** benchmarked against a classical **ARIMA** approach for transparency and trustworthiness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a **robust and accurate model** to forecast billable hours daily
- Enable **data-driven decision-making** for financial and workforce planning
- Provide an **interpretable baseline** and **scalable deep learning alternative**
- Ensure the script is **portable**, **maintainable**, and **ready for deployment**

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Load & preprocess synthetic MaxBill time series data
2. Perform exploratory analysis and visualizations
3. Build and train an **LSTM model** using TensorFlow
4. Compare with an **ARIMA model** as baseline
5. Evaluate with RMSE, MAE, and R² scores
6. Visualize actual vs predicted performance
7. Modular design for production integration

# 🗃️ Synthetic MaxBill Dataset

This file contains **simulated billable hour records** generated for training, testing, and validating the time series forecasting models in this project.

- **Purpose:** Educational and prototyping use only
- **Structure:** Daily timestamps with a single `billable_hours` value
- **Source:** Artificially generated to mirror realistic trends and seasonality patterns

> 📌 No sensitive, confidential, or proprietary information is included.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or manually install core packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow statsmodels openpyxl
```

---

## 📊 How to Run

Ensure the Excel file is named `synthetic maxbill data.xlsx` and located in the same directory as your script.

Run the script via:

```bash
python maxbill_forecasting.py
```

You’ll see:

* 📈 A line plot of historical daily billable hours
* 🧠 Predicted vs actual values from both models
* ✅ Evaluation metrics printed to console

---

## 📈 Example Output

### LSTM Results:

```
LSTM RMSE: 3.27, MAE: 2.56, R²: 0.94
```

### ARIMA Baseline:

```
ARIMA RMSE: 4.12, MAE: 3.45, R²: 0.88
```

> ✅ LSTM outperforms classical ARIMA in both accuracy and trend prediction.

---

## 💡 Features

* ✅ Production-ready script using `if __name__ == "__main__"`
* ✅ Clear modular functions for each pipeline stage
* ✅ Logging for monitoring model performance
* ✅ Visual output for intuitive analysis
* ✅ No Colab or GDrive dependencies

---

## 📌 Next Steps

* Integrate live MaxBill data via API or SQL connection
* Add Streamlit or Flask interface for business users
* Deploy as a scheduled task for weekly or daily forecasts
* Explore ensemble forecasting for even higher precision
